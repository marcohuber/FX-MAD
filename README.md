This is the repository to the paper "FX-MAD: Frequency-domain Explainability and Explainability-driven Unsupervised Detection of Face Morphing Attacks" accepted at WACV 2025 - Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Multimedia Forensics and Disinformation Detection.

In this repository, we provide the morphing attack pairs utilizied in the experiments.
